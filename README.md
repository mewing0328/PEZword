# PEZword

## Description
A password generator that will output a random secure password dependent on end-user inputs. This application represents JavaScript conditional statements, arrays, functions, methods, and other core JavaScript components.

### Usage
To provide greater security for password usage. The app generates a unique, random password from end-user choices.

### Tasks Completed
```
HTML & CSS: 
* Edited placeholder HTML text to be more descriptive of the first step of clicking on the red button
* Added personalization to the CSS code for design features representative of my unique app

JavaScript: 
* Activated button to commence the function of creating a password
* Created prompts for end-user to specify preferences for length and character types
* Added alerts for choice verification
* Included error alerts for constraints such as at least 8  and no more than 128 characters in length and at least one character type choice
* Enabled user to decide which character types to include in password (i.e. special, numeric, uppercase, and lowercase)
* Instructed JavaScript to generate a code that matches the end-user's selected criteria
* Replaced placeholder text on the page with the generated password
