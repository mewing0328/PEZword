# PEZword

## Description
A password generator that will output a random secure password dependent on end user inputs.
--- This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
---AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Usage


### Tasks Completed
HTML: Updated the browser tab and h1 to reflect my unique application name. Also, added instructions to click on the red button.


/*
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
DONE ---- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
DONE ---- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
DONE ---- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
DONE ---- THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
DONE ---- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
DONE ---- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
DONE ---- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

[PLACEHOLDER FOR THE GIF]

```
* Demo 1: From start to finish to generate a password. 
    Chosen number of characters is 20 characters long for the demo. 
    Chosen character types are special and upper case characters.
    - Prompts end-user through different character type choices for password
    - Prompt buttons are defined and inputs are confirmed with alerts
    - Password is shown on page replacing placeholder text
* Demo 2: Show error alerts for: 
    - if end-user chooses Cancel after welcome prompt
    - if length of characters: is not a number, less than 8, or more than 128 characters
    - if input is not a number for the number of characters
    - if "Cancel" is chosen for all special characters: At least one character type is required
