# Secure-Password
A password generator that will output a random secure password dependent on end user inputs.
--- This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
---AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security


Tasks Completed
HTML: Updated the browser tab and h1 to reflect my unique application name. Also, added instructions to click on the red button.

FOR THE DEMO gif:
1. Show error alert if number is not 8-128 characters
2. Show error alert if input is not a number for # of characters
3. Show error alert if "Cancel" is chosen for all special characters
4.
